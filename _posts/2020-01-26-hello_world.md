# Hello Blog!

This blog is created with Jeremy Howard's fast_template on github. It's a simple, free, and ad-free way to start writing blogs. I especially like that blogs can be written in Jupyter Notebooks and get published via git.

I will be writing stuff I find useful here in the format of technical notes. 

Jeremy's 4-part tutorial on fast_template can be found here:

His machine learning online course is also awesome.
